    "\n",
    "A simple neural network consisting of vector X, one hidden layer (H), and output Y, can be described by the following mathematical expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "`H = relu(W1 X)`\n",
    "`Y = sigmoid(W2 H)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where W1 and W2 are the weights of the respective hidden and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement this network with plain Python and NumPy, without using a Neural Network library such as Pytorch or Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to implement the inference pass, NOT the learning algorithm or anything sophisticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these 2 articles, where the same network is implemented in the Clojure programming language (you don't need to know it, treat the code as a pseudocode) as a guide.\n",
